This is make.info, produced by makeinfo version 6.1 from make.texi.

This file documents the GNU 'make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and
issues the commands to recompile them.

   This is Edition 0.74, last updated 21 May 2016, of 'The GNU Make
Manual', for GNU 'make' version 4.2.
